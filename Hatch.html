            <p>The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1981 with the goal of protecting and conserving sea turtles. The hatchery is located in the town of Bentota, on the south coast of Sri Lanka.
                The hatchery works to protect sea turtles in a number of ways. <br> First, it collects and incubates sea turtle eggs that have been laid on beaches in the area. The hatchery has a high success rate of hatching sea turtle eggs, and it releases thousands of baby turtles into the ocean each year.
                Second, the hatchery rehabilitates injured sea turtles. Sea turtles can be injured by fishing nets, boat propellers, and other human activities. The hatchery provides medical care to injured sea turtles and helps them to recover.</p>
